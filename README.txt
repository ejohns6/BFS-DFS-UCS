Simplistic Example to implement Breadth First Search, Depth First Seach, and 
Uniform Cost Search where it will ask for a command line of
FileInput Start_Node End_Node Search_type where
      -FileInput: is a file where it is a list of Node, Next_Node, and Weight where there
	is a sepration of a space and a range of 0 - (2 ^ (bits on machine - 1) - 1)
	Example: 2 8 1

      -Start_Node: The place where the "start of the trip" is

      -End_Node: The place where the "end of the trip" is

      -Search_type: is the type of search which is either BFS, DFS and UCS
